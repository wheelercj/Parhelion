— Norman Augustine   

“Software is a gas; it expands to fill its container.”
— Nathan Myhrvold  

“All parts should go together without forcing.  You must remember that the parts you are reassembling were disassembled by you.  Therefore, if you can’t get them together again, there must be a reason.  By all means, do not use a hammer.”
— IBM Manual, 1925  

“Standards are always out of date.  That’s what makes them standards.”
— Alan Bennett

— Donald E. Knuth   

“The Internet?  We are not interested in it.”
— Bill Gates, 1993   

“The best way to get accurate information on Usenet is to post something wrong and wait for corrections.”

“The most likely way for the world to be destroyed, most experts agree, is by accident.  That’s where we come in; we’re computer professionals.  We cause accidents.”
— Nathaniel Borenstein   

“Pessimists, we’re told, look at a glass containing 50% air and 50% water and see it as half empty.  Optimists, in contrast, see it as half full.  Engineers, of course, understand the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.”
— Bob Lewis   

“In a room full of top software designers, if two agree on the same thing, that’s a majority.”
— Bill Curtis   

“It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a DestroyBaghdad procedure.  Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a DestroyCity procedure, to which Baghdad could be given as a parameter.”
— Nathaniel S. Borenstein   

“Mostly, when you see programmers, they aren’t doing anything.  One of the attractive things about programmers is that you cannot tell whether or not they are working simply by looking at them.  Very often they’re sitting there seemingly drinking coffee and gossiping, or just staring into space.  What the programmer is trying to do is get a handle on all the individual and unrelated ideas that are scampering around in his head.”
— Charles M. Strauss   

“If you think you are worth what you know, you are very wrong.  Your knowledge today does not have much value beyond a couple of years.  Your value is what you can learn and how easily you can adapt to the changes this profession brings so often.”
— Jose M. Aguilar   

“Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.”

— Jeff Atwood

“Low-level programming is good for the programmer’s soul.”
— John Carmack

“It’s OK to figure out murder mysteries, but you shouldn’t need to figure out code.  You should be able to read it.”

“It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa.”
— Alan Perlis   

“Less than 10% of the code has to do with the ostensible purpose of the system; the rest deals with input-output, data validation, data structure maintenance, and other housekeeping.”
— Mary Shaw   

“If you have a procedure with ten parameters, you probably missed some.”
— Alan Perlis  

“How rare it is that maintaining someone else’s code is akin to entering a beautifully designed building, which you admire as you walk around and plan how to add a wing or do some redecorating. More often, maintaining someone else’s code is like being thrown headlong into a big pile of slimy, smelly garbage.”
— Bill Venners   

“Code generation, like drinking alcohol, is good in moderation.”
— Alex Lowe   

“Simplicity, carried to the extreme, becomes elegance.”
— Jon Franklin   

“A program is never less than 90% complete, and never more than 95% complete.”

“When you are stuck in a traffic jam with a Porsche, all you do is burn more gas in idle.  Scalability is about building wider roads, not about building faster cars.”
— Steve Swartz   

“Everyone by now presumably knows about the danger of premature optimization.  I think we should be just as worried about premature design — designing too early what a program should do.”
— Paul Graham   

“Programming without an overall architecture or design in mind is like exploring a cave with only a flashlight: You don’t know where you’ve been, you don’t know where you’re going, and you don’t know quite where you are.”
— Danny Thorpe   

“The best way to predict the future is to implement it.”
— David Heinemeier Hansson   

“We need above all to know about changes; no one wants or needs to be reminded 16 hours a day that his shoes are on.”
— David Hubel   

“On two occasions I have been asked, ‘If you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?’  I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.”
— Charles Babbage   

“Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.”
— Albert Einstein   

“Today, most software exists, not to solve a problem, but to interface with other software.”
— IO Angell   

“Good specifications will always improve programmer productivity far better than any programming tool or technique.”

— Edsger Dijkstra

— Yukihiro Matsumoto, aka “Matz”, creator of Ruby

— Stephen Hawking   

“The only truly secure system is one that is powered off, cast in a block of concrete and sealed in a lead-lined room with armed guards.”
— Gene Spafford   

“Being able to break security doesn’t make you a hacker anymore than being able to hotwire cars makes you an automotive engineer.”
— Eric Raymond   

“Companies spend millions of dollars on firewalls, encryption and secure access devices, and it’s money wasted, because none of these measures address the weakest link in the security chain.”
— Kevin Mitnick   

“If you think technology can solve your security problems, then you don’t understand the problems and you don’t understand the technology.”
— Bruce Schneier  

“Hoaxes use weaknesses in human behavior to ensure they are replicated and distributed.  In other words, hoaxes prey on the Human Operating System.”
— Stewart Kirkpatrick
