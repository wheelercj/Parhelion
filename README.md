A simple Discord bot that can play music, solve math questions, and send reminders. You can add the bot to your Discord server by clicking [this link](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?scope=bot&client_id=836071320328077332&permissions=3300352). After adding, you can see a full list of commands by entering `;help`.
