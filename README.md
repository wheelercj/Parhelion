A simple Discord bot that can play music, solve math questions, and send reminders.

## how to try this bot
There are two ways you can add this bot to Discord servers where you have "manage server" permissions:

1. By adding my instance of the bot to your server by clicking [this link](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?scope=bot&client_id=836071320328077332&permissions=3595328).
2. By making a fork of this repl and creating your own instance of the bot (see instructions below).

After adding this bot, you can see all the commands by entering `;help`.

## how to create your own instance of this bot
1. Create a Discord bot account ([see this guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-python/)), except don't create an `.env` file because Replit doesn't use those anymore. Instead, follow [this guide](https://docs.replit.com/repls/secrets-environment-variables) to set a Replit environment variable called `DISCORD_BOT_SECRET_TOKEN`.
2. To keep the bot running continuously without Replit's premium "always on" option, you can use a free UptimeRobot account as explained in the first guide linked above.
3. Replit isn't designed to host bots, so you will want to change hosts soon if you continue using the bot.
